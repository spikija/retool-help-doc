This is a help and manual for using the Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Academic Research Project.

Basic functionality

Pre-loaded patients are listed in the left pane. The details of each patient are shown after clicking on the table. The data then loads into the right pane.

The general rule is that for numeric variables, the default value for unknown status is -99 (minus ninety-nine). This value is pre-loaded in the empty form.

For categorical variables, such as gender or employment, there is always an option to choose the "Unknown" category. This should be selected when no data is available in the records.

Tabs:
Data about patients is entered through a series of tabs that can be selected from the top bar, such as "Cases", "Clinical", and so on.
One should start by filling out the "Cases" form with general data. This form will later be updated upon correct cerebral amyloid angiopathy classification.

Source of data: usually from PDF documents from hospital-based systems or interviews.
Categorisation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: done by an expert user, mostly study physician.
