<p>This is a help and manual for using the Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Academic Research Project.</p>
<p>Basic functionality</p>
<p>Pre-loaded patients are listed in the left pane. The details of each patient are shown after clicking on the table. The data then loads into the right pane.</p>
<p>The general rule is that for numeric variables, the default value for unknown status is -99 (minus ninety-nine). This value is pre-loaded in the empty form.</p>
<p>For categorical variables, such as gender or employment, there is always an option to choose the "Unknown" category. This should be selected when no data is available in the records.</p>
<p>Tabs:<br>
Data about patients is entered through a series of tabs that can be selected from the top bar, such as "Cases", "Clinical", and so on.<br>
One should start by filling out the "Cases" form with general data. This form will later be updated upon correct cerebral amyloid angiopathy classification.</p>
<p>Source of data: usually from PDF documents from hospital-based systems or interviews.<br>
Categorisation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: done by an expert user, mostly study physician.</p>
<p>Cases<br>
Data dumped checkbox - whether PDF data from ORBIS was locally extracted</p>
